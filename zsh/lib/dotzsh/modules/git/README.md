Settings
--------

### git prompt
The git module allows to create a custom prompt for git repositories. To do so,
each available information can be formatted separately then merged into `prompt`
and `rprompt`

#### Available informations
Each information has to be formatted before being inserted into the prompt.

The format is defined with a `zstyle` by providing the name of the element we
want to format, and the format.

    #zstyle ':dotzsh:module:git' Name 'Format code'
    zstyle ':dotzsh:module:git' branch 'Branch: %b'

Here is an exhaustive list of the elements and the format code that can be used:

<table>
  <tr><th>Name</th><th>Format code</th>
    <th>Content</th></tr>
  <tr><td>action</td><td>%s</td>
    <td>Special action name (am, merge, rebase).</td></tr>
  <tr><td>added</td><td>%a</td>
    <td>Indicator to notify of added files.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>ahead</td><td>%A</td>
    <td>Indicator to notify of ahead branch.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>branch</td><td>%b</td>
    <td>Branch name.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>behind</td><td>%B</td>
    <td>Indicator to notify of behind branch.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>commit</td><td>%c</td>
    <td>SHA-1 hash.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>deleted</td><td>%d</td>
    <td>Indicator to notify of deleted files.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>dirty</td><td>%D</td>
    <td>Indicator to notify of dirty files.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>modified</td><td>%m</td>
    <td>Indicator to notify of modified files.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>position</td><td>%p</td>
    <td>Current position in the git tree.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>renamed</td><td>%r</td>
    <td>Indicator to notify of renamed files.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>remote</td><td>%R</td
    ><td>Remote name.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>stashed</td><td>%S</td>
    <td>Indicator to notify of stashed files.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>untracked</td><td>%u</td>
    <td>Indicator to notify of untracked files.</td></tr>
  <tr><td>unmerged</td><td>%U</td>
    <td>Indicator to notify of unmerged files.</td></tr>
</table>

#### Prompt and rPrompt
Once every element has been pre-formated, 
- prompt, Left prompt.
- rprompt, Right prompt.

#### Conditional formatting
It's possible to add some conditions.

#### Ignore submodule.
Getting the current git status from a project with submodules can take a long
time.

##### Enable the ignore mode
It's possible to ignore the submodule when it is 'dirty', 'untracked',
'all', or 'none':

    zstyle ':dotzsh:module:git:ignore' submodule ''
