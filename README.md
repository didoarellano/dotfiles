# Dotfiles

## Todos
- Clean up Vim config
  - Purge configuration from the MacVim/gVim days. Optimize for terminal use.
  - Use vundle
- Switch to vanilla zsh config or fish
- Merge in emacs.d repository
- Improve makefile and directory structure
  - Delete existing symlinks before creating new ones. `make clean`
  - Config files bound for the .config directory don't work with current
    structure.
